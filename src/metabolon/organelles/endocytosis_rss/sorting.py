"""Endosome sorting: route scored cargo to one of three fates.

Biological analogy
------------------
Items entering the endosome are sorted by receptor-ligand affinity (score):

  transcytose — high-affinity cargo crosses the cell (score >= threshold_high).
                Forward to the surface; mark visually in the news log.
  store        — moderate-affinity cargo is retained in the lumen (score >= threshold_low).
                Write to the news log; worth keeping in chromatin.
  degrade      — low-affinity cargo is handed to the lysosome (score < threshold_low).
                Silently dropped; not persisted.
